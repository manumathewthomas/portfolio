I'm a PhD student in the Computational Media department at the University of California at Santa Cruz. I'm also a part of the [Creative Coding Lab](https://creativecoding.soe.ucsc.edu/news.php) supervised by Professor [Angus Forbes](https://creativecoding.soe.ucsc.edu/angus/). My research focuses on real-time graphics and machine learning. Recent advances have inspired me to explore AI-assisted techniques for real-time graphics. I aim to solve various rendering problems with deep learning solutions optimized for high performance.
