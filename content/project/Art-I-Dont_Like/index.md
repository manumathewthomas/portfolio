This work is motivated by a concern about current recommender system technology and
personalization algorithms. As people spend a considerable amount of time on the
Internet, their views on politics and social issues are shaped by the information they
consume online. Internet users may not realize that algorithms have been developed to
give them personalized content. By removing access to opposing viewpoints,
personalization can lead to filter bubbles—a term coined by Eli Pariser to describe a type
of intellectual isolation that occurs as a result of personalization algorithms. These
algorithms present information to users based on previously viewed content and content
viewed by similar users. Users have little exposure to contradicting viewpoints and have
become unknowingly trapped in a digital bubble (Pariser, 2011). The recommender
systems community is aware of this tendency, and researchers have explored ways to
mitigate content isolation. Some solutions include improving the transparency of these
systems (Cosley, 2003; Cacheda, 2011; Forbes, 2013), giving the user control over the
settings of the personalization algorithms (Hirschmeier, 2018), and using new
technologies to make recommender-system technology more understandable (Forbes,
2012). However, these solutions do not necessarily challenge the core underlying
assumption of such methodologies, which is that users want to be presented with content
that is as similar as possible to content they have indicated that they like. In addition, 
these solutions are not always clearly explained to the public, making them less aware of
the impact that recommender systems have on their Internet experience.

Art I Don’t Like (artidontlike.com) is a Web-based interactive art experience that
provides personalized content to users. Art I Don’t Like suggests content by prompting
users to pick artworks that they find visually appealing. This anti-recommender system
then returns an artwork that is dissimilar to the selected content. This system will expose
users to a broader range of art, and shed light on how recommendations are made. This
project gives users a digital space to view and interact with art that they have not
specifically searched for and probably would not search for. In this way, the
recommender system concept has been expanded to allow for serendipity and
exploration.
